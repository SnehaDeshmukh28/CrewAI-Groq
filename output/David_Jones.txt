Hey David Jones!

Hope you're doing great! I'm always sharing updates on my projects through LinkedIn and GitHub, so make sure to follow me there for the latest scoop and insights into my work.

As a DevOps engineer specializing in automation and continuous integration, your expertise would be incredibly valuable. If you have any questions or need a hand with your projects, just ping me on LinkedIn to set up a quick chat. I'm always up for connecting, collaborating, and lending a hand.

Currently, I'm working on various AI projects, so stay tuned for updates and exciting new developments. I recall our last conversation where you asked about the deployment process and potential bottlenecks. Feel free to ask any specific questions or share concerns you might have in this area.

Excited to catch up with you!

Best,
