Hi Sarah! ü§ù

I'm regularly sharing updates on my latest projects on LinkedIn and GitHub, so make sure you follow me there for the latest news and insights into my work.

If you have any questions or need assistance with your projects, just shoot me a message on LinkedIn, and we can schedule a quick call. I'm always happy to help and collaborate!

We recently talked about potential improvements to the database schema for better performance, and I'm excited to share that I've implemented some of those suggestions! I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback.

In the meantime, I'm working on various AI projects, so stay tuned for updates and new developments. I'm looking forward to connecting with you and sharing more!

Best,
Sneha Deshmukh
