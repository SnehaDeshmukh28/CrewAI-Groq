Hey Sarah!

I'm always sharing updates on my projects on LinkedIn and GitHub, so make sure to follow me there for the latest scoop and insights into my work.

As a software architect with a knack for scalable systems design, your input would be pure gold. If you've got questions or need a hand with your projects, just shoot me a message on LinkedIn to set up a quick chat. I'm always up for connecting, collaborating, and lending a hand.

I'm knee-deep in various AI projects, so stay tuned for updates and fresh developments. And, of course, I'm all ears for your database schema improvement suggestions to boost performance.

Excited to connect with you!

Best,
Sneha
