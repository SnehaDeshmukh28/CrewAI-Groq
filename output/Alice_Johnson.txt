Hey Alice,

Just wanted to touch base and let you know that I'm actively sharing updates on my projects through LinkedIn and GitHub. Be sure to follow me for the latest scoop and some exclusive insights into my work.

If you ever have questions or need a hand with your projects, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always here to help, connect, and collaborateâ€”especially with a fellow frontend developer who shares my passion for user experience design.

I'm currently knee-deep in some exciting AI projects, so stay tuned for updates and new developments. I can't wait to share more with you!

Excited to connect with you,
Sneha Deshmukh
