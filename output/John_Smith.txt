Hey John!

I'm regularly sharing updates on my AI projects on LinkedIn and GitHub, so make sure you follow me there for the latest news and insights. If you have any questions or need help with your projects, just shoot me a message on LinkedIn to schedule a quick call. I'm always here to connect, collaborate, and support fellow engineersâ€”especially seasoned ones like you with 10+ years of experience in backend development.

Stay tuned for more updates and new developments. Excited to connect with you!

Warm regards,
Sneha Deshmukh
