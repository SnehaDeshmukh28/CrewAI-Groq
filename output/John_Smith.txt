Hey John! ðŸ‘‹

Hope you're doing great! I'm constantly sharing updates about my projects on LinkedIn and GitHub, so make sure you follow me there for the latest scoop and insights!

If you've got any questions or need a hand with your projects, just drop me a line on LinkedIn, and we can set up a quick chat. I'm always up for connecting, brainstorming, and lending a handâ€”especially when it comes to backend development.

Currently, I'm knee-deep in some cool AI projects, so stay tuned for some exciting updates and new developments. I can't wait to share them with you!

Excited to connect with you!

Best,
Sneha Deshmukh
