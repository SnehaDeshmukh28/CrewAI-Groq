Hey [Name],

I'm reaching out to you because your agent stopped due to an iteration limit or time limit. I understand how frustrating that can be, especially when you're close to achieving your goals.

Let's work together to get your agent back on track. Can you please provide more context about what happened? Was there a specific issue that caused the stoppage, or was it a general timeout?

Once I have more information, I can help you identify the root cause and suggest a solution to get your agent running smoothly again.

Remember, we're in this together, and I'm committed to supporting you every step of the way. Your success is my top priority, and I'm confident that with a little troubleshooting, we can get your agent up and running in no time.

Looking forward to hearing back from you and resolving this issue together.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
